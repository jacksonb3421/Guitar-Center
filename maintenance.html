  <h2>Guitar Maintenance</h2>
  <p>Keeping your guitar in optimal condition ensures better sound quality, playability, and longevity. Here are some essential maintenance tips and step-by-step guides to help you care for your instrument:</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Cleaning Your Guitar</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a soft, dry microfiber cloth to wipe down the body and neck after each use to remove sweat and oils.</li>
      <li>Clean the fretboard with a slightly damp cloth; for rosewood or ebony fretboards, consider using lemon oil occasionally to condition the wood (avoid on maple fretboards).</li>
      <li>Use specialized guitar cleaning products for polishing the body to maintain the finish and remove fingerprints or smudges.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Changing Strings</h3>
    <p>Changing strings regularly improves tone and playability. Here’s a quick guide:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Loosen and remove old strings carefully.</li>
      <li>Clean the fretboard and bridge area while strings are off.</li>
      <li>Install new strings, securing them properly at the tuning pegs.</li>
      <li>Tune the strings gradually and stretch them gently to help hold tuning.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Depending on your playing frequency, change strings every 1-3 months.</p>

    <h3>Adjusting Neck Relief</h3>
    <p>The truss rod helps control the curvature of your guitar’s neck, impacting string action and playability. If you notice buzzing or high action, a truss rod adjustment might be needed. Proceed carefully or consult a professional:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Locate the truss rod adjustment at the headstock or inside the soundhole.</li>
      <li>Use the correct-sized wrench to make small adjustments (1/8 turn at a time).</li>
      <li>Turn clockwise to reduce relief (straighten the neck), counterclockwise to add relief (more bow).</li>
      <li>Allow the neck to settle between adjustments and retune frequently.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Storage & Environmental Care</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Store your guitar in a hard case or on a stand to prevent damage.</li>
      <li>Avoid exposing your guitar to extreme temperatures or humidity.</li>
      <li>Use a guitar humidifier or dehumidifier as needed to maintain ideal humidity (40-50%).</li>
      <li>Keep your guitar away from direct sunlight and heating vents.</li>
    </ul>
